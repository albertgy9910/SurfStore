# SurfStore
Designed and implemented a Dropbox-like cloud-based file storage service using Go, with features including distributed storage, consistent hashing algorithms

Built for large-scale data handling, the project showcased excellent scalability during tests and efficiently met the data storage demands of thousands of users through client-server communication via gRPC

Enhanced the system's fault tolerance by implementing the RAFT distributed consensus protocol, which led to a 50% improvement in error recovery efficiency during testing
